            <p>I started out this program hoping to learn more about how the coding process works in order to better understand how websites are made. Although I am interested in learning Python, I will not learn it in this course.</p>

            <ul class="exp_pg_hd"> 
            <li><h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>HTML provides the content that the user will view on the web. It is much like a word program in that a programmer types out letters and words, and they will see them when they go to the link. The programmer can apply certain tags to format the words in certain ways, much like the tabs in word allow the user to change how the information is presented. However; it is important to know that most of the visual formatting occurs in CSS.</p>        
                </li>
                <li><h4>CSS</h4>
                    <p>The program hasn't delved much into CSS yet, however; I know that this is the program used to alter how the information is shown, i.e. font, border, word effects.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>JS</h4>
                    <p> The program hasn't gone into JS yet, but I know that it is used for more robust effects, i.e. videos or modules.</p>
                </li>
